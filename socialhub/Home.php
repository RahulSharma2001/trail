    <h3 style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">In the present time, everyone is busy in doing their own
        work and they have not much time to connect with people, even with their own family. Due to this problem
        many of people are losing speaking skills and also they are not able to connect with other people which
        are not familiar with them. So, we have created a social networking site known as SOCIAL HUB, which will
        help people to connect with other people,
        no matter if they know or don not know each other.</u></h3>
